Joystick driver for Radiodetection's DVC2
=========================================

An evdev joystick driver for the Radiodetection DVC2 fpga.

The joystick interface from the fpga returns two values an x and y co-ordinate
of range 0x000 to 0xFFF (by default).  These limits can be adjusted using the
device tree, clipping the limits should the hardware report larger values.
Joystick fuzz is used to filter out noise on the joystick (reading deltas must
be greater than the fuzz to be raised as an event).

The fpga supporting the joystick is polled at a rate specified by poll_rate.
Raising the value here will increase i2c traffic.

Should calibration be selected, using the calibrate property, then the first
reading is assumed as the joystick center point ("centered").  The readings
are then adjusted so that the joystick reports a exactly half way between
joy_min and joy_max when the joystick is "centered".
